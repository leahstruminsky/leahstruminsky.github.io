    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <P> Hello! My name is Leah Struminsky. I am a senior Health Studies major with a specialization in health services at the Univeristy of Rhode Island. I am currently enrolled in CSC106: The Joy of Programming. I enrolled in this course hoping to learn something new, interesting, and useful. One of my favorite hobbies is art. I love to work with acrylic paint and colored pencil. I also like to learn new crafty skills like sewing, kintting, and crochet. </P>
