      Hello! My name is Leah Struminsky and I am from Rhode Island. I am a senior Health Studies major with a specialization in health services at the Univeristy of Rhode Island. I have thoroughly enjoyed the Health Studies program at URI. It is very interdisciplinary which has allowed me to explore many of the university's departments. As graduation approaches, I hope to find my place in the healthcare field. I am currently enrolled in CSC106: The Joy of Programming. I enrolled in this course hoping to learn another new, interesting, and useful skill before I move on from the university. One of my favorite hobbies is art. I love to work with acrylic paint and colored pencil. The artwork on the bottom right of this page is one of my favorites created with colored pencil, completed my senior year of highschool. I like to learn new crafty skills like sewing, knitting, and crochet as well. I also have a dog named Fitch who absolutely <em> loves </em> to go for car rides and walks. You can see a sweet picture of him on the bottom left, he's a goldendoodle!
